Official PyTorch implementation of the main ideas described in our paper [Shape from Caustics: Reconstruction of 3D-Printed Glass from Simulated Caustic Images](https://graphics.tu-bs.de/publications/kassubeck2020shape).

## Prerequisites


- [NVidia OptiX 6.5](https://developer.nvidia.com/designworks/optix/downloads/legacy)
- [PyTorch >= 1.7](https://pytorch.org/)
- [PyWavefront](https://pypi.org/project/PyWavefront/)
- [PyTorch Wavelets](https://github.com/fbcotter/pytorch_wavelets) (for using wavelet sparsity)
- [PyWavelets](https://pywavelets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing.html#installing-an-official-release)
- [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)
- [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard)
- [PyMongeAmpere](https://github.com/mrgt/PyMongeAmpere) (for running the reimplementation of [High-contrast computational caustic design](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2601097.2601200))

## Setup

First build the necessary OptiX `.ptx` files; we have provided a `CMakeLists.txt` file for this task (which should also be automatically invoked, when executing `setup.py`). 
To get the files into the correct location, the `install` Target has to be called:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --target install
```

Second build the PyTorch extensions by invoking `python setup.py install`. Be sure to change the paths in `setup.py` to the correct OptiX directory.

## Executing the code

If everything is set up correctly, you can call `python shape_from_caustics.py --help` to get an overview of the parameters for simulation and reconstruction. 
Alternatively you can also look at `hyperparameter_helper.py` to see, which parameters are available and which might take a list of arguments.
A call of `python shape_from_caustics.py` will start the simulation and reconstruction of a synthetic 3D printed glass sample with sensible initial parameters (for a GPU with 24GB VRAM).
If you have problems with `Out of memory` errors, try decreasing the `num_inner_simulations` parameter.
For a complete overview of parameters for the result in the paper, have a look at the [supplementary material](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/supplemental/Kassubeck_Shape_From_Caustics_WACV_2021_supplemental.pdf).

If you want to execute the reimplementation of [High-contrast computational caustic design](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2601097.2601200), look at `schwartzburg_2014/ma.py` and change the paths therein to the respective paths of `PyMongeAmpere` and `cgal-python` as well as to the input and output images in `__main__`.
